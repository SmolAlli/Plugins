# Plugins

A collection of my plugins.

Current plugins:

-   FixEsc - (OBSOLETE) Temporarily fixes Discord's issue where `esc` no longer makes the chat jump down to the most recent message. It's a simple solution, but it works.

-   TwitchInVC (tentative) - Shows an indication that someone in a VC is also live on Twitch.
